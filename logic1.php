              In this kinds of sentences, there are no subject , so we add a you before the sentence than we find

<span class="style1"> 5. <span class="style9">Negative Sentence</span> :
              The token of the nagative sentence is not or no . First, i delete not , no , do/does/did not and 
 make an affirmative sentence and find it's meaning than i </span>add the meaning of no or not . Ex :

 6. <span class="style10">Affirmative Sentence</span> : 
              English sentence structure is : Subject + Verb + Extention .
              Bangla sentence structure is : Subject + Extention + Verb .
 Tense are 3 types :
    a. Present - i. Present Indefinite : Subject + Verb (Present form) + object.
                ii. Present Continuous : Subject + am/is/are + Verb + ing + object.
               iii. Present Perfect : Subject + have/has + Verb (Past Participle) + object.
                iv. Present Perfect Continuous : Subject + have been/has been + verb + ing + object.
    b. Past    - i. Past Indefinite : Subject + Verb (Past form) + object.
                ii. Past Continuous : Subject + was/were + Verb + ing + object.
               iii. Past Perfect : Subject + had + Verb (Past Participle) + object.
                iv. Past Perfect Continuous : Subject + had been + verb + ing + object.
    c. Present - i. Future Indefinite : Subject + shall/will + Verb (Present form) + object.
                ii. Future Continuous : Subject + shall be/will be + Verb + ing + object.
               iii. Future Perfect : Subject + shall have/will have + Verb (Past Participle) + object.
                iv. Future Perfect Continuous : Subject + shall have been/will have been + verb + ing + object.
               First, i find the tense of the sentence by the uper structure than we find the meaning of the verb
 of that tense acording the person . Then i put the verb meaning at last of the sentence . 
               There are also, some tricks to made the bangla meaning meanful . Although in my sort time i could 
 not find and impliment all the logic of translation from english to bangla.
