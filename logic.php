 <div align="justify">
   <pre class="style2"><span class="style4">           In this software I convert Conplex,Compound,Interrogative,Imperative,Nagative and 
 Affirmative sentences . The main concept of the software is to find structure and then they 
 make bangla sentence according to their structure.I will describe details below : 
</span>
<span class="style1"> 1. <span class="style5">Complex Sentence</span> :
              In this kinds of sentences there are one principal clause and other subordinate clause. There are also
 some complex sentences token like : if,though,although,as,since,that,before,after etc. Ex : I know that he is honest.
              Here, i first divide the complex sentence into two simple sentence then i find their bangla sentence and
 then i add the two sentence into one sentence. Ex:
 I know -&gt; Avwg Rvwb
 he is honest -&gt; &Dagger;m mZ
 I know that he is honest -&gt; Avwg Rvwb &Dagger;h &Dagger;m mZ</span>

<span class="style1"> 2. <span class="style9">Compound Sentence</span> :
             Here , i add two or more principal clause. Some compound sentences token are and , or etc.
            </span> <span class="style1">Here, i first divide the compound sentence into two or more simple sentence then i find their bangla 
 sentence and then i add the two sentence into one sentence. Ex:
</span> <span class="style1">He is rich, but he is honest.
 He is rich -&gt; &Dagger;m abx
 he is honest -&gt; &Dagger;m mZ
 He is rich, but he is honest. -&gt; &Dagger;m abx, wKbZz &Dagger;m mZ
 3. <span class="style10">Interrogative Sentence</span> : 
             I used &quot;?&quot; as interrogative token . I change the interrogative sentence as a similar assertive sentence
 then i find the meaning of the assertive sentence then i transfer it's meaning to the interrogative sentence. Ex : 
 What are you reading ? -&gt; are you reading -&gt; you are reading.
 you are reading. -&gt; Zzwg cwo&Dagger;Z&Dagger;Qv
 What are you reading ? -&gt; Zzwg wK cwo&Dagger;Z&Dagger;Qv ?   </span>
